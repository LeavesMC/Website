      <p>
        LeavesMC has grown significantly past what it was originally created to
        be â€” a small group of tightly-knit developers having fun on a side
        project, never really intending it to go anywhere. With this fact in
        mind, we need to be proactive and explicit about how we intend to combat
        negativity and toxicity in the LeavesMC community. We want LeavesMC to be
        a welcoming community to all, where new members feel safe to hang out
        and ask questions, and where old members are happy to hang out, chat,
        and help others too. We want LeavesMC to be an inclusive environment.
        LeavesMC is, at its core, a development community. We want to continue
        staying focused on being a development community rather than letting
        toxic behavior take over. This document is the definitive list of
        guidelines everyone in the community must follow to participate in this
        community.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">The LeavesMC Community</h2>
      <p>
        This document uses the phrase &quot;LeavesMC community&quot; to refer to
        all communication which happens within the LeavesMC ecosystem. This
        includes every forum of communication that is officially part of the
        LeavesMC project. To be abundantly clear, these LeavesMC Community
        Guidelines apply to all of the following:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4">
        <li>The LeavesMC Discord server</li>
        <li>The LeavesMC QQ group</li>
        <li>The LeavesMC GitHub organization</li>
        <li>
          This includes issues, pull requests, and any discussion inside issues
          or pull requests
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section
      id="the-leaves-community"
      className="px-4 py-4 max-w-7xl mx-auto leading-7 "
    >
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        LeavesMC has a fairly short and sweet set of rules. It generally comes
        down to:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside my-4 ml-4">
        <li>Don&apos;t be a jerk</li>
        <li>Listen to project staff</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We do this because creating an exhaustive list for all negative behavior
        we want to avoid is impossible and likely won&apos;t help anyways. The
        kinds of people who would engage in such a way in the first place
        probably aren&apos;t the people we want around at all.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, there are specific behaviors we want to avoid in our community.
        The following behaviors are not permitted in the LeavesMC community:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside my-4 ml-4 space-y-2 py-1">
        <li>
          Using language or posting content that can reasonably be considered
          discriminatory.
          <ol className="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
            <li>
              Most of the language banned here should be obvious, but will be
              listed in more detail below in{" "}
              <a

                Zero Tolerance Items.
              </a>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Posting pornographic, distasteful, or excessively violent content.
          <ol className="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
            <li>This is similar to the first rule.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Spamming or excessively sending messages, including repeating
          questions, resending links too frequently, or posting the same
          question to multiple channels.
          <ol className="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
            <li>
              Spam bots and trolling users will be immediately banned without
              warning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users who are looking for help and are incessantly repeating
              questions because they aren&apos;t receiving any answers should be
              asked to stop repeating their question so often and be patient
              instead. They should also be directed to <code>#support</code>{" "}
              if they aren&apos;t there already.
              <ol className="list-roman list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
                <li>
                  Repeating a question after some time has passed and the
                  question is no longer current and the conversation has changed
                  is fine, as long as it&apos;s not too repetitive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Repeating a question because the user is receiving help but
                  doesn&apos;t like the answer they received is not fine.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Trying to buy or sell services or hire developers. This is not a
          marketplace.
        </li>
        <li>
          Formatting usernames to be difficult to read, to impersonate others,
          to advertise, or to be inappropriate.
          <ol className="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
            <li>
              Non-hateful and non-bigoted cursing is fine for the most part, but
              not in usernames. If someone is cursing in every message, they
              should be asked to calm down and stop using those words so much.
              If a curse word is in their username, that&apos;s basically the
              same as saying that word every time they send a message &mdash; so
              it&apos;s the same problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Impersonating people includes anyone in or out of the server, not
              just staff and not just those in Leaves.
            </li>
            <li>
              People often try to put their servers or plugins in their
              usernames, which seems a little distasteful. Users can put their
              server or plugins in their Discord status and it will appear if
              anyone clicks on their names. Including server or plugin names in
              their username also potentially makes their name ridiculously
              long.
            </li>
            <li>
              Usernames that are nothing but a bunch of symbols that are
              impossible to pronounce aren&apos;t very conducive of a good
              conversation environment. However, this does not apply to
              usernames in different languages and alphabets. There is a
              difference between having a username in Japanese and having only
              random symbols as your username.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Pinging server staff, moderators, or contributors without a valid
          reason.
          <ol className="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
            <li>
              Valid reasons include when normal users may not be able to help,
              or when reporting dupe glitches or critical bugs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anyone with a role is a target for pinging, and the larger Leaves
              gets, the more of an issue this becomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone pinging a particular person because they are responding to
              that person is not a problem and not even warranting of a warning.
              Someone pinging a project developer or contributor just because
              they want an answer in <code>#support</code> is what is
              addressed here.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are some users who don&apos;t want to be pinged, so please
              respect their decision.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Discussing politics or political controversy. We prohibit this in
          order to prevent the degeneration of our chat channels.
          <ol className="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
            <li>
              This does not apply to instances where people are speaking about
              their everyday lives or current events - only when discussion
              devolves to the point of being solely about some political scandal
              or controversy.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Discussing the bypassing or exploiting of Minecraft&apos;s player
          safety features in any way that is malicious or harmful. This applies
          to discussion around how to bypass chat reporting specifically, as
          well as any other features that make Minecraft a safer place for its
          users.
          <ol className="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
            <li>
              This does not apply to general discussion of the safety features
              themselves, nor does it apply to discussion of these
              features&apos; potential downsides. Further we will not forbid
              general discussion of &apos;proper&apos; ways to disable safety
              features for legitimate reasons. Only those meaning to bypass them
              for the sake of avoiding accountability or otherwise being
              malicious will be punished.

          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If someone is violating those feel free to use the <code>@Leaves Team</code>{" "}
        ping on Discord to notify the LeavesMC team.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Zero Tolerance Items</h2>
      <p>
        Particularly severe issues represent a behavior and a kind of person we
        don&apos;t want associated with LeavesMC in any way. These behaviors will
        result in an immediate ban without warning:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4 ml-4">
        <li>Racial slurs or racist speech</li>
        <li>Sexist slurs or sexist speech</li>
        <li>Homophobic or transphobic slurs or speech</li>
        <li>
          Ableist slurs or speech &mdash; there&apos;s confusion around this
          term, so to help clarify:
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 py-1">
            <li>
              Ableist slurs are words that refer to people with disabilities
              used as insults
            </li>
            <li>
              Ableist speech is hate speech directed towards people with
              disabilities
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Any other hate speech not already listed</li>
        <li>Doxxing people</li>
        <li>Personal attacks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This list is not exhaustive. If someone is engaging in bad behavior not
        conducive to a friendly environment, and we believe it warrants an
        immediate ban, then we will do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        When someone is removed for violating one of these items, all messages
        in question will be removed as well and reported to Discord if
        necessary.

        Topic Specific Channels on Discord
      </h2>
      <p>
        LeavesMC has channels dedicated to specific topics, and conversations in
        these channels should stay on-topic. This can help newer members in
        particular to feel more comfortable asking questions in the help
        channels if other members aren&apos;t also talking over them about
        other, unrelated topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moderators will shut down any off-topic discussions happening in any of
        the following channels and ask for the conversation to be moved to{" "}
        <code>#general</code> instead:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside my-4 ml-4">
        <li>
          <code>#support</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section
      id="support-channels"
      className="px-4 py-4 max-w-7xl mx-auto leading-7 "
    >
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Support Channels</h2>
      <p>
        Our support channels <code>#support</code>,{" "}is there
        for people who need support using our software. While we are very happy
        that so many members of the community actively support there and answer
        questions, please make sure to follow our guidelines there as well. Many
        people that go there to ask questions are new to Minecraft Servers and
        to the community itself. We should be welcoming towards newcomers,
        especially since we all started somewhere. In general, &quot;Rule 1:
        Don&apos;t be a jerk&quot; applies here as well, but we would like to
        add the following points:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside my-4 ml-4 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Please don&apos;t harass people for using software/plugins that you
          don&apos;t like. We know that some plugins are not that well received
          in this community, but as long as they are not causing the issue
          itself, you shouldn&apos;t harass people for using them. This
          doesn&apos;t mean that you can&apos;t recommend a replacement. Again,
          as stated in rule 1, if you don&apos;t like if someone is using a
          specific software, you can always choose to just ignore the question
          and let someone else answer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please be polite even when turning down help. LeavesMC does not
          officially support older versions of our software, and that is not
          likely to change. We generally discourage people from using our older
          software, and we stipulate that it comes with no support. This does
          not mean users asking for support for older versions should be mocked
          or yelled at, however.
        </li>
