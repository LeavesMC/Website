With this fact in mind, we need to be proactive and explicit about how we intend to combat negativity and toxicity in the LeavesMC community. We want LeavesMC to be a welcoming community to all, where new members feel safe to hang out and ask questions, and where old members are happy to hang out, chat, and help others too. We want LeavesMC to be an inclusive environment. LeavesMC is, at its core, a development community. We want to continue staying focused on being a development community rather than letting toxic behavior take over. This document is the definitive list of guidelines everyone in the community must follow to participate in this community."
